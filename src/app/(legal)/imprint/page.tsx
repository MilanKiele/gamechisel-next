              <p>

                paragraph 1 German Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to Sec. 8 to 10 German Telemedia Act (TMG), 
                service providers are not under obligation to permanently monitor submitted or stored information or to 
                search for evidences that indicate illegal activities.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Legal obligations to removing information or to blocking the use of information remain unchallenged. 
                In this case, liability is only possible at the time of knowledge about a specific violation of law. 
                Illegal contents will be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">Liability for Links</h3>
              <p>
                Our offer includes links to external third party websites. We have no influence on the contents of 
                those websites, therefore we cannot guarantee for those contents. Providers or administrators of

              <p>
                The linked websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the time of the establishment 
                of the link. Illegal contents were not detected at the time of the linking. However, a permanent 
                monitoring of the contents of linked websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that 
                there has been a violation of law. Illegal links will be removed immediately at the time we get 
                knowledge of them.
